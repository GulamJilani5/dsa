#  Dynamic Programming
- DP is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.


### Problems it solves:
- Fibonacci sequence.
- Knapsack problem.
- Longest common subsequence.
- Coin change problem.
- Matrix chain multiplication.
