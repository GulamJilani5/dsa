# Dynamic Programming

- DP is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

### Problems it solves:

- Fibonacci Number (Top-Down and Bottom-Up DP)
- Climbing Stairs
- 0/1 Knapsack problem.
- House Robber
- Longest common subsequence.
- Coin change problem.
- Matrix chain multiplication.
- Given an integer array, find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum

- Finding maximum product subaaray
  Find answer `D:\Jilani\learning\dsa\src\patterns\DynamicProgramming\codes\dp-1.md`
