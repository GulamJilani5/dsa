### Fast And Slow Pointer
The fast and slow pointer technique (also known as the tortoise and hare approach) is a two-pointer 
strategy commonly used in algorithms involving linked lists, arrays, or sequences. Itâ€™s especially useful
when you need to detect cycles, find middle elements, or handle certain patterns efficiently.

### Definition:
The fast and slow pointer technique involves initializing two pointers at the same starting position. 
One pointer (slow) moves one step at a time, while the other (fast) moves two steps. The relative movement 
helps detect patterns or relationships in the data.


### Purpose:
- Detecting cycles in linked lists.
- Finding the middle of a linked list.
- Detecting duplicates or repeated patterns.
- Optimizing time and space complexity.
