# Two Pointers
- Two pointers technique involves using two pointers (indices) to traverse a data structure (usually an array or linked list) simultaneously to solve problems efficiently.
- O(n) time.

### Problems it solves:
- Pair sum problems (find two numbers that sum to a target).
- Removing duplicates from sorted arrays
- Checking for palindromes
- Merging two sorted arrays
- Finding the intersection of two arrays
