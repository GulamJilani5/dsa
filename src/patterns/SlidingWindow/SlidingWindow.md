# Sliding Window Pattern

- The sliding window technique maintains a subset (window) of data that slides through the larger dataset.
- Solving problems by focusing on this window rather than the entire dataset at once.

### Problems it solves:

- Best time to buy and sell stock
  Find answer `D:\Jilani\learning\dsa\src\patterns\SlidingWindow\coding\slidingwindow_1.md`
- find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in the array.
  Find answer `D:\Jilani\learning\dsa\src\patterns\SlidingWindow\coding\slidingwindow_1.md`
- Finding maximum/minimum sum of subarrays of a given size k.
  Find answer `D:\Jilani\learning\dsa\src\patterns\SlidingWindow\SlidingWindowMaxSum.java`
- Finding the Maximum Average of subarrays of the size k
  Find answer `D:\Jilani\learning\dsa\src\patterns\SlidingWindow\SlidingWindowMaxSum.java`
- Longest substring with K distinct characters.
  Find answer `D:\Jilani\learning\dsa\src\patterns\SlidingWindow\SlidingWindowMaxSum.java`
- Maximum counting subarray
- Problems involving contiguous subarrays/substrings.
- String permutation problems.
