# Sliding Window Pattern

- The sliding window technique maintains a subset (window) of data that slides through the larger dataset.
- Solving problems by focusing on this window rather than the entire dataset at once.

### Problems it solves:

- Best time to buy and sell stock
  Find answer `D:\Jilani\learning\dsa\src\patterns\SlidingWindow\coding\slidingwindow_1.md`
- Finding maximum/minimum subarrays of a given size.
- Finding maximum product subaaray
  Find answer `D:\Jilani\learning\dsa\src\patterns\SlidingWindow\coding\slidingwindow_1.md`
- Longest substring with K distinct characters.
- Problems involving contiguous subarrays/substrings.
- String permutation problems.
