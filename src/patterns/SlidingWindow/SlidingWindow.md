# Sliding Window Pattern

- The sliding window technique maintains a subset (window) of data that slides through the larger dataset.
- Solving problems by focusing on this window rather than the entire dataset at once.

### Problems it solves:
- Finding maximum/minimum subarrays of a given size.
- Longest substring with K distinct characters.
- Problems involving contiguous subarrays/substrings.
- String permutation problems.
